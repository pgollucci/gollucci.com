# Inside P6M7G8 Inc.

Hopefully the question you've all been asking all these years is --
> "What does P6M7G8 Inc actually do?"

TL;DR - It helps people.

The focus on this article is on how its **Technology** helps them.
Specifically with _Infrastructure_, _Websites_, and _CI/CD_

## Infrastructure As Code

Really this means not only **Everything** as **Code** but also **Everything** from _Code_.

Graphical User Interfaces (GUI)s are great, but they are not the _tools_ of the trade.
Nor are they the most efficient way to take advantage of Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT).
They may be in the future but they are not yet and it will likely be a bit before they are.

No, I'm not walking back my AI Linked in series from 2023.

I stand by that. I'm clarifying here, that to use AI well you

As it turns out, I know what good likes like, with some AI help,
and this is a piece of what P6M7G8 Inc. does

## Run a Startup business

- Needs a Problem, a Category, a Point of View (POV), and a Vision for the category
- Needs a Product (Solution)
- Needs a Website[SaaS] (talk to customers)

Sadly, Wall Street has decided that they want to pay repeated to do the below and a bunch of this has no APIs
and thusly is not not trivially automatable.

> Why? I have no idea, and its maddening!

However, we have brought it to its near absolute *minimum* (especially for repeatability)
