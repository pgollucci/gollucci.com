# Inside P6M7G8 Inc.

Hopefully, the question you've all been asking over the years is —
> "What does P6M7G8 Inc. actually do?"

**TL;DR:** It helps people.

This article focuses on how **Technology** at <code></code> supports this mission, specifically through _Infrastructure_, _Websites_, and _CI/CD_.

## Infrastructure As Code

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) at P6M7G8 Inc. means not only **Everything** as **Code** but also **Everything** from _Code_.

Graphical User Interfaces (GUI)s are great, but they are not the _tools_ of the trade.
Nor are they the most efficient way to take advantage of Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT).
They may be in the future but they are not yet and it will likely be a bit before they are.

No, this doesn’t walk back my 2023 LinkedIn AI series:

I stand by that. I'm clarifying here, that to use AI well you
> "have to know what good looks like."

This is part of what P6M7G8 Inc. strives to accomplish.

## Running a Startup Business

A startup needs:

- A Problem, a Category, a Point of View (POV), and a Vision.
- A Product (Solution).
- A Website (SaaS/Product) to engage customers.

Sadly, Wall Street has decided that they want to pay repeatedly to do the below and a bunch of this has no APIs thus is not not trivially automatable.
> Why? I have no idea, and it's maddening!

Despite this, we've managed to minimize these tasks, maximizing **repeatability**.
